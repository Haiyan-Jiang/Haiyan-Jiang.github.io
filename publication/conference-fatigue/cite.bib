abstract="As working at a video display terminal (VDT) for a long time can induce visual fatigue, this paper proposed a method to use dynamic disparity on the situation of video watching in head-mounted displays (HMD), based on the accommodative training. And an experiment was designed to evaluate whether it can alleviate visual fatigue. Subjective and objective methods were combined in the experiment under different disparity conditions to evaluate the visual fatigue of the subjects. The objective assessment was the blink frequency of the subjects, achieved by the eye tracker. The subjective assessment was questionnaire. However, we came to the conclusion that dynamic disparity caused by the movement of left and right eye images in the HMD can't effectively alleviate visual fatigue. According to the change of the average eye blink frequency ratio of the subjects during the experiment, the change of the visual fatigue over time was analyzed.",
